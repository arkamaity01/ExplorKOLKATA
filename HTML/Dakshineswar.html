            <strong>Dakshineswar Kali Temple</strong><br>majestic 19th-century temple in the village of Dakshineswar, outside Kolkata, India, on the east bank of the Hugli River, an arm of the Ganges. The presiding deity is Bhavatarini, an aspect of
            the goddess Kali, but it is a pilgrimage site for both Hindus and members of other religions, too, largely because of the temple’s association with Ramakrishna, who was the priest here for 30 years in the 19th century. According to tradition,
            in 1847 the wealthy widow Rani Rashmoni was preparing to go by boat from Calcutta to the sacred city of Banares (Varanasi) in order to worship the Divine Mother. The night before she planned to leave, the Divine Mother appeared to her in a
            dream as Kali, telling her that there was no need to go to Banares and that instead, she should erect the goddess’s statue in a beautiful temple on the banks of the Ganges and arrange for her worship there. Profoundly affected, Rashmoni purchased
            20 acres (8 ha) of land, and work began immediately. The resulting complex has at its centre a nine-spired temple to Kali that is 150 square feet (14 sq m) and rises to a height of more than 100 feet (30 m). In addition, there are 12 other
            temples dedicated to Shiva and to Radha and Krishna. Rashmoni spent a fortune on construction and yet more money on the consecration ceremony, which took place on May 31, 1855. When Ramkumar, the first priest, died within the year, responsibility
            passed to his younger brother, Ramakrishna, and his wife, Sarada Devi ,Convinced of the transitory nature of worldly matters, Ramakrishna, an important Hindu religious teacher who was also an influential figure in the 19th-century Bengal Renaissance, emphasized the harmony of all religions. The continuing popularity
            of his ideas means that his room, in the northwestern corner of the courtyard, beyond the last of the Shiva temples, is one of the most visited parts of the temple complex.
